# Minesweeper

This was purely meant to mess around with the new hotness, Svelte. Overall, it really reminds me of Vue quite a bit. I am not sure if I am the biggest fan of how they handle reactivity with arrays/objects but I could also just blatantly be approaching it the wrong way. I will definitely come back at some point and try my hand at Svelte again.
